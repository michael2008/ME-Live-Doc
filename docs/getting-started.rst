Welcome
=============

MeshExpert Live! is a real-time Mixed-Reality (MR) filming and show
product developed by DataMesh. It is intensively designed on top of
HoloLens, so that mixed-reality could be perceived by more people.
Leveraging on our solution, HoloLens users can see amazing MR images,
while those who do not wear HoloLens can also experience MR scenes
through ME Live! in real-time. Meanwhile, the gap among different
devices of sharing the same MR experiences can be well bridged by
incorporating the collaboration feature offered by ME Live!, where you
could easily interact with mixed realities via all sorts of VR/AR
glasses and even mobiles and tablets, which creates various
possibilities for immersive mixed-reality experiences.

Main Features
=============

    Our solution supports real-time casting of mixed-reality scenes.
    Through a set of equipment of paired HoloLens and ME-Live!, you can
